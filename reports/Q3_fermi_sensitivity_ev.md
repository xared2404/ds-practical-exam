# Q3. Scenario Analysis and Projections

This section develops forward-looking CO₂ emissions projections for Mexico and the United States, building directly on the econometric models estimated in Q2. The objective is to assess how alternative assumptions regarding economic growth and decarbonization translate into divergent emissions trajectories over the period 2024–2035.

All projections rely on a balanced country–year panel covering 1990–2023 and are explicitly interpreted as **scenario-based projections**, not point forecasts.

## Q3.1 Baseline and Alternative Emissions Scenarios (2024–2035)

### Methodological Overview

Projections are constructed using the **log-link specifications** estimated in Q2. This functional form ensures strictly positive predictions and avoids the implausible negative values generated by linear extrapolation when forecasting beyond the estimation sample.

Two models are employed:

- **Model A (log-link)**: Total CO₂ emissions (million tonnes)
- **Model B (log-link)**: CO₂ emissions per capita (tons per person)

Future GDP and population paths are extrapolated using recent historical growth rates. These projected macroeconomic trajectories are then combined with the estimated regression coefficients to generate emissions forecasts under alternative assumptions.

---

### Scenario Definitions

Three scenarios are considered:

#### 1. Baseline Scenario
- Continues recent trends in GDP growth, population growth, and the estimated negative time trend in emissions.
- Assumes **ongoing but moderate decoupling** between economic activity and CO₂ emissions.
- Represents a business-as-usual pathway with gradual technological and efficiency improvements.

#### 2. No-Decoupling Scenario
- Assumes economic growth continues but **no further technological progress or efficiency gains** occur.
- The time trend is shut down, implying emissions scale proportionally with GDP and population.
- Serves as a counterfactual upper bound illustrating the cost of inaction.

#### 3. Strong Decoupling Scenario
- Assumes accelerated technological change, stronger environmental regulation, and faster reductions in emissions intensity.
- The negative time trend is amplified relative to the baseline.
- Represents an optimistic mitigation pathway consistent with ambitious climate policy.

### Results: Total CO₂ Emissions

Figure 1 presents historical total CO₂ emissions (1990–2023) together with projected emissions (2024–2035) under the three scenarios for Mexico and the United States.

Three clear patterns emerge:
	•	Under the baseline scenario, emissions decline gradually in both countries.
	•	Under no decoupling, emissions rise sharply, particularly in the United States.
	•	Under strong decoupling, emissions fall substantially below historical levels.

These results highlight the central role of continued technological progress and policy intervention in shaping aggregate emissions trajectories.

⸻

### Results: CO₂ Emissions per Capita

Figure 2 shows projected CO₂ emissions per capita.
	•	Per-capita emissions decline over time in all scenarios except no decoupling.
	•	The United States remains at higher per-capita levels than Mexico, although the gap narrows significantly under strong decoupling.
	•	Strong decoupling yields large reductions in individual carbon intensity by 2035.

These dynamics reinforce the distinction between emissions scale and emissions intensity emphasized in Q2.

⸻

### Emissions Avoided by 2035

To quantify the policy relevance of decoupling, emissions avoided are computed relative to the no-decoupling counterfactual.

### Total CO₂ emissions avoided in 2035

| Country | Baseline vs No-Decoupling | Strong vs No-Decoupling |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Mexico | ≈ 190 Mt                  | ≈ 255 Mt                 |
| USA    | ≈ 2,500 Mt                | ≈ 3,360 Mt               |

These magnitudes illustrate the substantial climate benefits associated with sustained or accelerated decoupling, particularly for high-emitting economies.

Interpretation (Q3.1)

Three main insights emerge from the scenario analysis:
	1.	Economic growth alone does not determine emissions outcomes. Policy choices, technological change, and regulatory frameworks are decisive.
	2.	Time dynamics dominate income effects in the medium run, consistent with the fixed-effects evidence in Q2.
	3.	Delayed action is costly. Emissions avoided under strong decoupling are several times larger than under baseline assumptions.

⸻

Conclusion (Q3.1)

The scenario analysis demonstrates that future CO₂ emissions paths are highly sensitive to decarbonization dynamics rather than to economic growth alone. Without continued improvements in emissions intensity, emissions would increase substantially. Conversely, accelerated decoupling yields large and economically meaningful reductions by 2035.

These findings motivate a systematic robustness assessment of the projections, developed in Q3.2.

Q3.2 Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis

This subsection evaluates whether the qualitative conclusions of Q3.1 depend critically on specific modeling choices or parameter assumptions.

Rather than introducing new data, the robustness analysis relies on alternative model structures and parameter variations already estimated in Q2.

⸻

Functional-Form Robustness: Linear vs Log-Link Models

As documented in Q2, linear OLS specifications for total CO₂ emissions can generate implausible negative predictions when extrapolated beyond the estimation sample, particularly for Mexico.

To address this limitation, all scenarios in Q3.1 are based on log-link specifications, which ensure:
	•	strictly positive emissions predictions,
	•	smoother extrapolation dynamics,
	•	greater plausibility over the medium-term horizon.

As a robustness check, projections were also computed using linear specifications. Although predicted levels differ in magnitude, scenario ordering remains unchanged:
	•	No decoupling always produces the highest emissions,
	•	Strong decoupling always produces the lowest emissions,
	•	The baseline lies strictly between the two.

⸻

Sensitivity to Time-Trend Assumptions

A key driver of the projections is the negative time trend in emissions identified in Q2.

Three variants were implemented:
	•	No decoupling: time trend set to zero,
	•	Baseline: time trend equal to the estimated coefficient,
	•	Strong decoupling: amplified negative time trend.

Across all variants:
	•	Time dynamics dominate income effects,
	•	Small changes in decoupling rates generate large cumulative differences by 2035.

These results are fully consistent with the two-way fixed-effects findings in Q2.

⸻

Country-Specific Robustness

Despite the panel including only two countries, qualitative patterns remain stable:
	•	The United States consistently exhibits higher total emissions due to economic scale.
	•	Per-capita emissions decline faster in the United States.
	•	Mexico’s trajectories are more sensitive to decoupling assumptions.

These patterns hold across pooled OLS, fixed effects, log-link models, and scenario projections.

⸻

Internal Consistency Checks

Several internal checks were performed:
	•	Total and per-capita projections align with population paths,
	•	Avoided emissions are strictly positive under baseline and strong decoupling,
	•	Scenario rankings never reverse across countries or outcomes.

No internal inconsistencies were detected.

⸻

Conclusion (Q3.2)

The robustness analysis confirms that the scenario results presented in Q3.1 are structurally stable and not artifacts of a particular specification. Time-driven decarbonization dynamics, rather than income growth alone, emerge as the dominant determinant of future emissions paths.

⸻

Transition

Taken together, Q3.1 and Q3.2 show that future CO₂ emissions trajectories are primarily shaped by policy-driven and technological decarbonization dynamics. The next section synthesizes these findings and discusses their broader implications for climate policy and applied economic modeling.

## Q3.3 Policy Implications, Limitations, and Synthesis

This subsection synthesizes the scenario results from Q3.1 and the robustness assessment in Q3.2. It translates the quantitative findings into policy-relevant insights, discusses the main limitations of the scenario-based approach, and provides an integrated interpretation of the overall analysis.

### Q3.3.1 Policy Implications

The scenario analysis yields several clear implications for climate policy and economic planning.

First, the results demonstrate that **economic growth alone does not determine emissions trajectories**. Under the no-decoupling scenario, continued GDP and population growth lead to sharply rising emissions, particularly in the United States. In contrast, both the baseline and strong decoupling scenarios show declining emissions despite ongoing economic expansion. This highlights the decisive role of **policy-driven technological change, regulation, and efficiency improvements**.

Second, the magnitude of emissions avoided by 2035 underscores the **nonlinear benefits of early and sustained action**. For both countries, avoided emissions under strong decoupling are substantially larger than under baseline assumptions. This implies that incremental policy improvements are insufficient: ambitious and sustained decarbonization policies generate disproportionately large climate benefits over the medium term.

Third, the cross-country comparison suggests differentiated policy priorities. While the United States faces the largest absolute mitigation gains due to its scale of emissions, Mexico’s trajectories are more sensitive to the assumed pace of decoupling. This indicates that **policy timing and institutional capacity** may be especially critical for emerging economies.

Overall, the findings support policy frameworks that emphasize long-run structural change—such as clean energy investment, carbon pricing, and regulatory standards—rather than relying on income growth alone to deliver emissions reductions.

---

### Q3.3.2 Limitations of the Scenario-Based Approach

Despite their usefulness, the projections presented in Q3 are subject to several important limitations.

First, the scenarios are **not forecasts** but conditional projections. They extrapolate historical relationships under stylized assumptions about future growth and decarbonization trends. Unexpected structural breaks—such as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical shocks, or major policy reversals—could lead to substantially different outcomes.

Second, the panel includes only two countries. While this allows for a transparent comparison, it limits the external validity of the results. The estimated time trends and income effects may not generalize to economies with different institutional structures, energy mixes, or development paths.

Third, the decoupling mechanisms are captured in reduced form through time trends rather than explicit policy variables. As a result, the analysis cannot identify which specific policies or technologies drive the observed decarbonization dynamics.

Finally, uncertainty around long-run GDP and population growth is not modeled explicitly. The scenarios condition on smooth extrapolations of recent trends, which may underestimate future volatility.

These limitations imply that the results should be interpreted as **illustrative and comparative**, rather than predictive.

---

### Q3.3.3 Integrated Synthesis

Taken together, Q3.1–Q3.3 provide a coherent picture of medium-term emissions dynamics.

The scenario analysis shows that future CO₂ emissions paths are highly sensitive to assumptions about decarbonization, while the robustness checks confirm that these conclusions are stable across alternative functional forms and parameter choices. Time-driven dynamics dominate income effects, and policy-relevant insights are not artifacts of a particular specification.

The key message is that **decarbonization is a choice, not an automatic outcome of growth**. Without sustained policy intervention, emissions would rise markedly; with accelerated decoupling, substantial reductions are achievable within little more than a decade.

From a methodological perspective, the exercise illustrates how econometric models estimated on historical data can be combined with transparent scenario assumptions to inform policy discussions—while also highlighting the importance of robustness analysis and cautious interpretation.

This completes the scenario-based assessment of emissions trajectories. The next section builds on these findings to draw broader conclusions about economic growth, environmental sustainability, and the role of policy in shaping long-run outcomes.
