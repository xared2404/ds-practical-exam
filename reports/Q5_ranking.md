###Q5 Country Prioritization Ranking

This section presents a country-level prioritization ranking that operationalizes the strategic framework developed in Q5, using regime transition probabilities estimated in Q4A.

The ranking is designed for policymakers, multilateral institutions, and strategic planners seeking to allocate limited mitigation and clean-energy resources under constraints. It should be interpreted as a measure of transition readiness, not as a ranking of emissions levels, environmental performance, or historical responsibility.

⸻

Purpose and Scope

The objective of this ranking is to translate probabilistic regime detection into a practical allocation tool. Rather than forecasting emissions or ranking countries by income or size, the table identifies countries where investments are most likely to accelerate and lock in ongoing decarbonization dynamics.

Importantly:
	•	The ranking reflects readiness for transition, not aggregate mitigation potential.
	•	It complements—rather than replaces—the conceptual typology and decision logic developed in Q5.1–Q5.2.
	•	Results should be interpreted jointly with structural (Q2) and scenario-based (Q3) evidence.

⸻

Construction of the Ranking

Countries are ranked using a simple, interpretable composite indicator based primarily on model-based regime transition probabilities estimated in Q4A.

The ranking is driven by:
	•	Average predicted probability of transition in the most recent evaluation window (avg_p_transition_recentN), which serves as the primary component of the priority score.
	•	Recent emissions dynamics, particularly changes in per-capita CO₂ emissions (d_co2_per_capita), used as a diagnostic and consistency check rather than as a direct mechanical weight.

The resulting priority score captures how consistently and strongly a country exhibits signals associated with entry into a low-emissions-growth regime in recent years.

⸻

Interpretation Guidance

Higher-ranked countries tend to exhibit:
	•	Persistent or stable declines in per-capita emissions,
	•	High and stable predicted transition probabilities across recent periods,
	•	Emissions dynamics consistent with structural decoupling rather than short-lived shocks.

Lower-ranked countries typically display weaker or more volatile signals, suggesting lower short-run readiness for rapid decarbonization acceleration.

Crucially, priority is not assigned based on income level, country size, or absolute emissions, but on dynamic decarbonization momentum.

How to Use This Ranking

This ranking should be used as an input to strategic allocation decisions, not as a standalone prescription.

In practical terms:
	•	Top-ranked countries are strong candidates for scaling investments, where marginal capital is likely to yield fast and durable emissions reductions.
	•	Mid-ranked countries correspond to the “marginal transition” category in Q5 and may require targeted, catalytic interventions.
	•	Lower-ranked countries are better suited for long-horizon institutional or capacity-building strategies rather than immediate mitigation deployment.

⸻

Important Caveat

This ranking does not measure global mitigation impact, emissions responsibility, or fairness considerations. Countries with high scores tend to be smaller and institutionally strong, reflecting high readiness rather than large aggregate emissions reductions.

Accordingly, the ranking should be interpreted as identifying where interventions are most likely to succeed, not where they are most morally or historically justified.
