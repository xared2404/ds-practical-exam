###Conclusion

This project examined the relationship between economic activity and CO₂ emissions through a multi-layered empirical strategy combining econometric analysis, scenario-based simulation, machine learning classification, and decision-oriented synthesis.

The results consistently show that economic growth alone does not determine emissions outcomes. While scale effects dominate in static regressions, emissions trajectories are fundamentally shaped by dynamic processes—in particular, how emissions evolve relative to growth over time.

The econometric analysis (Q2) established that time dynamics dominate static income effects, revealing a significant downward trend in emissions intensity even when economic scale continues to expand. This finding challenges purely cross-sectional interpretations of the growth–emissions relationship and motivates a shift toward dynamic analysis.

Scenario simulations (Q3) demonstrated that small differences in decoupling rates accumulate into large long-run emissions gaps. These results underscore the nonlinear and path-dependent nature of emissions trajectories, highlighting the importance of early and sustained policy intervention rather than reliance on long-run equilibrium outcomes.

Building on these insights, the classification framework (Q4) showed that emissions regime transitions can be detected using a compact and interpretable set of macro-environmental indicators when temporal structure is respected. Dynamic emissions measures consistently outperformed static economic variables, and explainability analysis confirmed that recent emissions trends—not income levels—are the primary drivers of regime identification.

Building on the empirical and modeling results of Q2–Q4, Q5 shows how regime detection and scenario sensitivity can be operationalized into a decision-oriented prioritization framework, linking predictive analysis to real-world policy allocation under constraints.

Finally, the strategic synthesis (Q5) translated empirical evidence into a decision framework for allocating limited policy and investment resources. Rather than ranking countries by income or emissions levels, the framework emphasizes dynamic readiness, policy leverage, and timing, offering a principled approach to prioritization under real-world constraints.
