# Conclusion

This project used a layered empirical strategy—econometrics (Q2), scenario projection (Q3), classification and explainability (Q4), and decision-oriented synthesis (Q5)—to study how economic growth and dynamics shape CO$_2$ emissions.

Key conclusions:


Overall, the project emphasizes that decarbonization is a policy and technology choice; detecting and accelerating regime transitions is a practical lever for achieving meaningful emissions reductions.
- Q3: small differences in decoupling compound into large long-run gaps; scenarios highlight the policy value of early action.

- Q4: regime transitions are detectable with compact dynamic indicators; SHAP explainability shows dynamics > levels.
