# Conclusion

This project used a layered empirical strategy—econometrics (Q2), scenario projection (Q3), classification and explainability (Q4), and decision-oriented synthesis (Q5)—to study how economic growth and dynamics shape CO₂ emissions.

Key conclusions:

- Economic growth alone does not determine emissions outcomes; dynamic processes and decoupling trends matter.
- Q2: time dynamics dominate static income effects; emissions intensity shows a downward trend after controlling for scale.
- Q3: small differences in decoupling compound into large long-run gaps; scenarios highlight the policy value of early action.
- Q4: regime transitions are detectable with compact dynamic indicators; SHAP explainability shows dynamics > levels.
- Q5: combining readiness, scenario leverage, and structural feasibility yields a practical prioritization logic for allocating scarce mitigation resources.

Overall, the project emphasizes that decarbonization is a policy and technology choice; detecting and accelerating regime transitions is a practical lever for achieving meaningful emissions reductions.
