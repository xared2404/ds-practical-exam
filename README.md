# Decarbonization Dynamics, Regime Transitions, and Strategic Prioritization

This repository contains the complete analytical pipeline for a data science exam project focused on the relationship between economic growth and CO₂ emissions, the detection of emissions regime transitions, and the strategic prioritization of mitigation investments under constraints.

The project combines econometric modeling, scenario analysis, machine-learning classification, and policy-oriented decision frameworks.

## Analytical Overview

### Q2 — Econometric Foundations
- Panel OLS models for Mexico and the United States (1990–2023)
- Total CO₂ emissions and per-capita emissions
- Fixed effects and EKC robustness checks
- Key result: **time dynamics dominate static income effects**

📄 See: `reports/Q2_predictive_modeling.md`

---

### Q3 — Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis
- Fermi-style scenario exploration
- Small changes in decoupling rates generate large long-run emissions gaps
- Emphasizes leverage and path dependence

📄 See: `reports/Q3_fermi_sensitivity_ev.md`

---

### Q4 — Classification and Explainability (Q4A)
- Multicountry supervised classification (~200 countries)
- Target: entry into low-emissions-growth regimes
- Features emphasize dynamics (first differences)
- Rolling temporal validation
- SHAP-based explainability

📄 See: `reports/Q4_classification_policy.md`

---

### Q5 — Strategic Investment Prioritization
- Translates Q2–Q4 into a decision-oriented framework
- Focus on allocation under constraints
- Readiness–impact tradeoff
- Investment typology: high-probability, marginal, low-probability transitions

📄 See: `reports/Q5_strategic_analysis.md`

## Reproducing the Analysis

### 1. Environment setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Build the multicountry panel (Q4A)

Fetch and harmonize World Bank and OWID data:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/q4a_fetch_panel_all.py
```

Build the country–year panel:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/q4a_build_multicountry_panel.py
```

⸻

3. Feature engineering

Construct interpretable level and dynamic features:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/q4a_features.py```

Output:

```bash
data/processed/q4a_features.parquet```

⸻

4. Train classification models

Run rolling temporal validation and export predictions:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/q4a_train.py```

Outputs:
	•	Model metrics
	•	Rolling-split performance
	•	Country–year predictions

⸻

5. Strategic prioritization (Q5)

Translate classification results into investment categories:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/q5_prioritization.py
```


⸻

Key Methodological Principles
	•	Temporal integrity: no information leakage across time
	•	Interpretability: compact, theory-consistent feature sets
	•	Robustness: consistency across econometrics, scenarios, and ML
	•	Policy relevance: emphasis on dynamics and early-warning signals

Conclusion

This project shows that decarbonization outcomes are not determined by income levels alone. Instead, how emissions evolve relative to growth—and how quickly those dynamics change—drives both long-run outcomes and strategic policy relevance.

Dynamic signals dominate static indicators, and early detection of regime transitions enables more effective and efficient allocation of limited mitigation resources.
